## üéØ Completed Features

### 1. Database Infrastructure
- ‚úì Defined comprehensive TypeScript types for database schema
- ‚úì Created SQL schema with Row Level Security (RLS) policies and indexes
- ‚úì Added proper data validation and constraints
- ‚úì Set up cascading deletes for related data

**Implementation Details:**
- **Files**: 
  - `/types/*.ts` - Database type definitions
  - `/supabase/functions/schema.sql` - Database schema definition
  - `/scripts/migrateToSupabase.js` - Migration script with RLS policies
- **Approach**: Created a strongly-typed schema with TypeScript interfaces that map directly to database tables. RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data, with cascading deletes maintaining data integrity.

### 2. Database Service Layer
- ‚úì Created DatabaseService with generic CRUD operations
- ‚úì Implemented query builder with filtering and pagination
- ‚úì Added transaction support
- ‚úì Type-safe database operations

**Implementation Details:**
- **Files**: 
  - `/services/databaseService.ts` - Core database service
  - `/services/cacheService.ts` - Caching layer integration
  - `/test/services/databaseService.test.ts` - Unit tests
- **Approach**: Implemented a generic database service with type parameters for strongly-typed operations. The service handles CRUD operations with built-in error handling and supports filtering, pagination, and transactions. All database access throughout the app is funneled through this service to ensure consistency.

### 3. Core Services

  - `/components/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx` - Privacy controls
  - `/components/NotificationSettingsScreen.tsx` - Notification controls
  - `/components/SecuritySettingsScreen.tsx` - Security controls (Password, 2FA, Sessions)
- **Approach**: Created a comprehensive settings system accessible via the Profile screen. Settings are organized into distinct screens for clarity (Profile, Privacy, Notifications, Security). State management for settings relies on local component state, with API calls planned for persistence (via `userService`).

#### 4.6 UI Theme Refactoring & Standardization (Profile & Static Screens)
- ‚úì **Goal**: Enhance UI consistency, maintainability, and enable theme switching (Light/Dark modes).
- ‚úì **Theme Integration**: Replaced direct `useContext(ThemeContext)` with the `useTheme()` hook for cleaner access to theme properties (primarily `colors`).
- ‚úì **Style Optimization**: Wrapped `StyleSheet.create` calls within components in `useMemo` hooks. This ensures styles depending on theme `colors` are only recalculated when the theme actually changes, improving performance.
- ‚úì **Component Standardization**: Applied consistent styling across multiple screens using theme variables. Examples include:
    - **Layout**: Consistent use of `SafeAreaView` and `ScrollView` with standard padding (`padding: 16`).
    - **Sectioning**: Grouped related content within card-like `View` components styled using `colors.cardBg`, `colors.border`, `borderRadius: 12`, and consistent padding/margins. Section titles use `colors.text` and a standard font size/weight.
    - **Inputs**: `TextInput` components styled using `colors.inputBackground`, `colors.border`, `colors.text`, and `colors.secondaryText` for placeholders, with consistent padding and border radius.
    - **Buttons**: `TouchableOpacity` buttons styled consistently using `colors.primary` for background, `colors.buttonText` for text, and `borderRadius: 25`. Disabled states use `colors.disabled`.
    - **Switches**: `Switch` components in settings screens styled using `colors.primary` (true track), `colors.border` (false track/iOS background), and adjusted thumb colors.
    - **Typography**: Standardized font sizes and weights for main titles, section titles, content text, labels, and descriptions, using `colors.text` and `colors.secondaryText`.
- ‚úì **Helper Component Refactoring**: Updated shared components like `SettingRow` (used in Privacy, Notifications, Security) and `CategoryButton` (used in Report Problem, Contact Us) to internally use `useTheme()` and apply themed styles.
- ‚úì **Loading States**: Integrated `ActivityIndicator` (using `colors.primary` or `colors.buttonText`) for asynchronous operations like fetching data or submitting forms.
- ‚úì **Guest Views**: Implemented consistent placeholder views for guests on screens requiring authentication, using `Ionicons`, themed text (`colors.text`, `colors.secondaryText`), and a themed "Create Account / Sign In" button (`colors.primary`, `colors.buttonText`).

**Implementation Details:**
- **Files Affected**:
  - `/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Source of theme data.
  - `/components/EditProfileScreen.tsx` - Refactored profile editing form.
  - `/components/PrivacySettingsScreen.tsx` - Refactored privacy toggles and layout.
  - `/components/NotificationSettingsScreen.tsx` - Refactored notification toggles and layout.
  - `/components/SecuritySettingsScreen.tsx` - Refactored 2FA, password change, and session list.
  - `/components/HelpCenterScreen.tsx` - Refactored layout, resource cards, and feature sections.
  - `/components/ReportProblemScreen.tsx` - Refactored form inputs, category buttons, and layout.
  - `/components/ContactUsScreen.tsx` - Refactored form inputs, category buttons, and layout.
  - `/components/TermsAndConditionsScreen.tsx` - Refactored static content display.
  - `/components/PrivacyPolicyScreen.tsx` - Refactored static content display.
- **Approach**: Systematically replaced hardcoded styles and direct context consumption with the `useTheme()` hook and theme variables across the specified profile settings and static content screens. Leveraged `useMemo` for style definitions dependent on theme colors. Ensured common UI elements and states (loading, guest) have a consistent look and feel based on the active theme.
